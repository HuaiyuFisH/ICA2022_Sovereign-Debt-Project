# FAQs
## 1. World Systems Theory
- Initial WST classified the word system into three fixed categories: core, peripheral, and semi-peripheral countries depending on their economical, political, and cultural power (Wallerstein, 1974).
- Initial communication research adopted WST solely focused on how news organizations in core countries produced news stories flow to those in peripheral or semi-peripheral countries  (Wu, 1998).
- We proposed that the current world economic system is more complicated and fluid than in the past, and thus we should use countries’ attributes (e.g., population) and economic resources (e.g., GDP) rather than stick to the past fixed categories.

## 2. Operationalization for opionion leaders & in-degree centrality
- A reliable measurement that helps us to identify the position of each account within the social network.
We use in-degree centrality rather than out-degree centrality to define opinion leaders because this measurement focuses on how the account is retweeted by others. 
- We defined opinion leaders as those with the top 1% of in-degree among all accounts in our dataset according to the operationalization of Guo et al (2020).
